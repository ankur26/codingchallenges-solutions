# Coding Challenge solutions

## Preface
This is a set of weekly coding challenges published by [John Crickett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett) aimed to getting software engineers to make their own version of a real world based tool in a language of their choice. Read more on [codingchallenges.fyi](codingchallenges.fyi).

This is my attempt at the challenges.


## Folder structure (work in progress)
Each folder will have a README to explain how to setup the code on your local device if you want to play around with it, also there will some additional notes to document the learnings of the challenge.
