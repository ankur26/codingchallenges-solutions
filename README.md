# Coding Challenge solutions

## Preface
This is a set of weekly coding challenges published by [John Crickett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett) aimed to getting software engineers to make their own version of a real world based tool in a language of their choice. Read more on [codingchallenges.fyi](codingchallenges.fyi).

This is my attempt at the challeneges as an attempt to get familiarity with lower level langugages. My language of choice will be C.


## Folder structure (work in progress)
Each folder will have a makefile and a README to explain the solution, also will include test files which are provided by the author, and a test runner.

## Challenges
